Most of the way through the weekend, I still hadn't found an
admissable heuristic function I liked, or implemented anything other
than various attempts at faster simulators so I could churn out more
states.

I decided to implement Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as an
alternative to A* since I didn't have a good heuristic.
